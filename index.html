          <h3>About Us</h3>
          <p3 style="color: black; font-weight: bolder;">Doctor WHO has had three names since its establishment in 1901. It was originally called the Native Civil Hospital & had a bed capacity of 40. It is recorded that in 1908, there were 45 beds & that 712 inpatients and 6,425 outpatients were seen.

            A more modern part of the hospital, 300 bedded medical wing was completed in 1939. Extensions were made in 1951 & 1953 with the completion of 300 bedded surgical wing & Ismail Rahimtulla Wing to accommodate patients from the Asian Community, increasing bed capacity to 600.
            
            Feb 6, 1952, after a long illness, King George VI of Great Britain and Northern Ireland died in his sleep at the royal estate at Sandringham aged 56. It is in 1952 that the Native Civil Hospital was renamed the King George VI Hospital. When King George VI died, his daughter, Queen Elizabeth (25), was in Kenya on a royal tour.
            
            In 1957, the Infectious Disease Hospital was added with 234 beds, and in 1965, the British Military Hospital in Kabete was taken over as the Orthopedic Unit. Later a Dental Wing was added. Orthopaedic patients were managed at the British Military Hospital in Kabete. Trauma and acute cases were treated at KNH. After the construction of the present DoctorWHO, the Orthopaedic Unit was moved to Kenyatta and Kabete Unit was handed back to the military.
            DoctorWHO is the biggest referral hospital in East & Central Africa. Powered by Kenyans. DoctorWHO is 15+ years old</p3>
